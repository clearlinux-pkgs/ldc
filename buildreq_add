# FIXME: The build breaks when linking with libLLVMSPIRVLib.a (from
# llvm-staticdev), which disables ldc's SPIR-V target. Try re-enabling
# llvm-staticdev after updating to LLVM 10 (which will include the latest
# SPIRV-LLVM-Translator snapshot). This is the error:
#
#   : CommandLine Error: Option 'spirv-mem2reg' registered more than once!
#   LLVM ERROR: inconsistency in registered CommandLine options
